# Images
To embed images within a markdown document like the example image below we use the syntax

`![Alternative Text](<file path> "Title")`

- The title simply shows the defined text when the image is hovered upon.
- The alternative text is the text shown for screen readers if the image can't be rendered.

![Example Image 01](/Images/Image_01.jpg "Example Image One")

Of course, you can also add links to your rendered image like the example shown below by using the syntax

`[![Alternative Text](<file path> "Title")](<link>)`

[![Example Image Two](/Images/Image_02.jpg "Example Image Two")](https://github.com/GlitchedNexus/Learning-Markdown/blob/main/Images/Image_02.jpg)

Essentially, you can think of images as rendered links with additional syntax. As such, you can manipulate links!
