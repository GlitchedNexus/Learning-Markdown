# Headings
When writing text is it essential for us to have a hierarchy within the 
content to highlight logical progression. As you would have probably 
guessed by now, we use chained `#` to represent headings.

For more clear understanding I have described the headings as levels.
Where the highest level is one and the lowest level is six.

The number of `#` represents the position of the heading in the hierarchy used
to organize the text. We have at most a heading at the sixth level.
Let us look at the example below.

# Main Heading (Level 1)
This is the heading below where all subheadings will fall unless we add another
heading at level 1.

## Subheading (Level 2)
This subheading is contained within the level one heading.

### Subheading (Level 3)
This subheading is contained within the level two heading.

#### Subheading (Level 4)
This subheading is contained within the level three heading.

##### Subheading (Level 5)
This subheading is contained within the level three heading.

###### Subheading (Level 6)
This subheading is contained within the level three heading.

#### Subheading (Level 4)
This subheading is also contained within the level three heading.

# Another Main Heading (Level 1)


# Interpreting the hierarchy
It is difficult to understand the hierarchy from the text above so we will
use a list to explain how the text in the example above is organized.

Main Heading (Level 1)
- subheading (Level 2)
    - subheading (Level 3)
        - subheading (Level 4)
            - subheading (Level 5)
                - subheading (Level 6)
        - subheading (Level 4)

Another Main Heading (Level 1)

Using `#` we can therefore organize content in a logical order. While there are
no strict rules that prevent us from organizing text with arbitrary heading levels,
making sure that we follow the correct order makes our text easier to organize and
ensures that the logical order does not change when we intersperse new headings
within our content.

**NOTE:** Always precede the heading text with a space to ensure that our markdown code
is compatible with all markdown processors.
