# Headings
When writing text is it essential for us to have a hierarchy within the 
content to highlight logical progression. As you would have probably 
guessed by now, we use chained `#` to represent headings.

For more clear understanding I have described the headings as levels.
Where the highest level is one and the lowest level is six.

The number of `#` represent the position of the heading in the hierarchy 
used to organise the text. We have have atmost a heading at the sixth level.
Let us look at the example below.

# Main Heading (Level 1)
This is the heading below which all subheading will fall unless we add another
heading at level 1.

## Sub Heading (Level 2)
This sub heading is contained within the level one heading.

### Sub Heading (Level 3)
This sub heading is contained within the level two heading.

#### Sub Heading (Level 4)
This sub heading is contained within the level three heading.

##### Sub Heading (Level 5)
This sub heading is contained within the level three heading.

###### Sub Heading (Level 6)
This sub heading is contained within the level three heading.

#### Sub Heading (Level 4)
This sub heading is also contained within the level three heading.

# Another Main Heading (Level 1)


# Interpreting the hierarchy
We is difficult to understand the hierarchy from the text above so we will
use a list to explain how the text in the example above is organised.

Main Heading (Level 1)
- Sub Heading (Level 2)
    - Sub Heading (Level 3)
        - Sub Heading (Level 4)
            - Sub Heading (Level 5)
                - Sub Heading (Level 6)
        - Sub Heading (Level 4)

Another Main Heading (Level 1)

Using `#` we can therefore organise content in a logical order. While there are
no strict rules which prevent us from organising text with arbitrary heading levels,
making sure that we follow the correct order makes our text easier to organised and 
ensures that the logical order is not changes when we intersprese new headings
within our content.

**NOTE:** Always precede the heading text with a space to ensure that our markdown code
is compatible with all mardown processors.
