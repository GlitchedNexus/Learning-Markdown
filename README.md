# Learning-Markdown

I have spent nearly a decade making notes in Markdown. I used multiple different editors and note-taking software till I settled with Obsidian after its launch [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)](https://obsidian.md). 

Whilst it is not difficult to get up and running in markdown, it may look daunting to someone who is not familiar with it.

The goal of this repository is to get you up and running with markdown so you can make beautiful notes on the go.

I hope you find this repository helpful and let me know if there are things I can improve.

# Structure
I have tried to atomize as much of the content as possible so that you can start at any part of the course and become familiar with a given aspect of markdown. However, I suggest that if you are just starting with markdown, you should start with `Headings.md` as headings are extremely important to markdown documents to main logical progression.

# How To Use This Repository. 
I suggest having the rendered and unrendered versions of the markdown files side by side so that you can see what different elements look like when rendered and their corresponding syntax.
