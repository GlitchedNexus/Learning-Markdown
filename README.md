# Learning-Markdown

I have spent nearly a decade making notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

Whilst it is not difficult to get up and running in markdown,
it may look daunting to someone who is not familiar with it.

In this repository, I am trying to get you up and running with markdown
so you can make beautiful notes on the go.

# Structure
While there is no need to go through the repo in a step-by-step fashion. 
If you are new to markdown I would suggest doing so in the order given below
as the content builds on itself.
