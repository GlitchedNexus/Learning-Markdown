# Paragraphs
Say we want to break text into paragraphs. We we can simply to this
by leaving a blank line between the two paragraphs.

We separate this paragraph from the text above by leaving a blank line
before the paragraph.

Also note that unless we are putting paragraphs inside lists. We must not
put tabs or spaces at the start of the paragraph. Keep the lines left aligned
to prevent formatting errors.

# Line Breaks

Sometimes you don't want to separate content into different paragraphs but just
want to start on a new line. In that case, just leave 2 or more blank
spaces (trailing whitespace) at the end of the previous line and press enter.  
Now your cursor is on a new line!

## Bold
To make text bold, simply enclose it with `**` on both sides as follows
`**Your text goes here**`. Now we must ensure that we have any preceding or trailing
white spaces in the string we are trying to enclose. Below is an example of bold text.

**This text is bold**

## Italics
Similar to the way we make textbold, to make text italics, simply enclose it with
`*` on both sides as follows `*Your text goes here*`. Now we must ensure that we have
any preceding or trailing white spaces in the string we are trying to enclose.
Below is an example of italicised text.

*This text is italicised*

## Bold & Italics

Sometimes you want a piece of text to be both bold and italicised. In these cases
we can enclose the text in question using `***` on both sides as we did in the 
cases for bold and italics as follows, `***Your text goes here***`. Below is an 
example of bold and italicised text.

***This is the fancy text.***
