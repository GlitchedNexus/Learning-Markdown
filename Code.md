# Code
Markdown also allows to write code snippets. We can do this by using one or more backticks.

We enclose code blocks with three backticks. You can also add the language you are working with at the top of your code block directly following the three backticks. An example of this is:

```Java
public static void main(string args[]) {
    int a = 3;
    int b = 4;
}
```

We can also add inline snippers as follows `int a`.
